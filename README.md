# DBE - Distributed_Systems_SS20
## Hands-On Support

On this page you will find examples for the lecture: DBE - Distrubuted Computing SS20

The examples and internet sources should support you by handling the practical part out in the lecture.

Most links will tend to be readings on architecture itself and some of them will have examples.

You can find an excellent introduction for distrubted systems @aphyr's: [An Introduction to Distributed Systems](https://github.com/aphyr/distsys-class)

## Papers

Must read papers on distributed systems. While nearly all of Lamport's work should feature here, just adding a few that must be read.

[Times, Clocks and Ordering of Events in Distributed Systems](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/time-clocks-ordering-events-distributed-system/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fum%2Fpeople%2Flamport%2Fpubs%2Ftime-clocks.pdf) Lamport's paper, the Quintessential distributed systems primer

[Session Guarantees for Weakly Consistent Replicated Data](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~dahlin/Classes/GradOS/papers/SessionGuaranteesPDIS.pdf) a '94 paper that talks about various recommendations for session guarantees for eventually consistent systems, many of this would be standard vocabulary in reading other dist. sys papers, like monotonic reads, read your writes etc.

## Programming Models
